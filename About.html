    <h1>History</h1>
</div>


<div class="home-content1">
    <p>Tiki Takos was founded by Juan C. Del Mundo on March 3, 2001, it started out as a small food stall named "Takorific!" in Laguna, usually selling food on the streets of Santa Cruz. Del Mundo opened a restaurant in Santa Rosa, Laguna after saving a little bit of money, but later decided to move to San Miguel, Bulacan. Following that, the restaurant made significant efforts and successfully expanded its operations, opening up numerous branches across the country, all with the aim of serving you the finest tacos!</p>
